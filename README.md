PerfectPathfinding mod for RimWorld, updated for 1.5

## How to get and use this mod
The easiest way would be to just [download the archive](https://github.com/mantazzo/RimWorld-PerfectPathfinding/archive/refs/heads/1.5.zip) and then extract the content of the archive (the mod folder) to the RimWorld Mods directory.
If done correctly, the mod should show up in the modlist in the game.

You can also Clone it as well, but for general usage, downloading the archive is the easiest way to go.

## What was changed?
The mod didn't require any major changes. It didn't work properly on RimWorld 1.5 anyway due to missing method. So I had to dig a little, and found out that the method name used in 1.5 has changed a little. So I changed that.

Additionally, I bumped the .NET SDK requirement to 4.8 instead of original 4.7.2.

Otherwise, no additional fixing was required and the mod now seems to be functioning as intended.

## What about the original mod?
For preservation, I left the original mod in the "original" branch if you're interested in that. The original mod is also still available on [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2341486509) and will not conflict with this version.

To clarify, I am not the creator of original mod, I just fixed the issue to make it work on Game version 1.5.
